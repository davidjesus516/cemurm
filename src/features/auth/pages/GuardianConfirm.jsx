// Hito 4 — the GUARDIAN'S half of the consent handshake
// (features/minors-and-guardian-consent.feature scenario 2).
//
// Migration 0031 mails the guardian a one-shot link
//   `${siteUrl}/guardian/confirm?user=…&token=…`
// (supabase/functions/send-guardian-consent/index.ts:219) and grants
// public.confirm_guardian_consent_by_token to `anon`, so the transition from
// 'pending' to 'active' is the GUARDIAN's to make with no account and no
// session. Before this page existed the email was a dead end: the minor could
// open a request and the row could never leave 'pending'.
//
// Three obligations are load-bearing here, not decoration:
//
//   1. STRIP THE CAPABILITY. The token is read once into component state and
//      then removed from the address bar, so it survives neither a bookmark nor
//      a Referer header. The edge function's comment (:216-218) states this
//      obligation; this file is the other half of it.
//   2. ONE MESSAGE FOR EVERY FAILURE. The server raises a single string for a
//      wrong token, an unknown account, an already-confirmed consent, a revoked
//      one and a no-longer-minor account alike (0031:252-261). This page must
//      not turn that back into distinguishable states, or the URL becomes an
//      oracle for "does this account exist" / "was this consent already used".
//   3. NO AUTO-SUBMIT. This flips a supervision record for a child on the
//      strength of a link in an inbox. It is a deliberate click or it is
//      nothing — a page that confirmed on render would let anything that can
//      prefetch a URL (a mail client, a chat client, a security scanner) spend a
//      child's consent without a human ever seeing the words.
//
// ONE THING THIS PAGE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT SAY: the email also carries a
// revoke link, and that link does not work. private.revoke_guardian_consent
// (0017:361) needs p_guardian_email as part of its witness, and the emailed URL
// carries only `user` and `token`. So the copy below says consent "can be
// withdrawn at any time" and stops there, instead of pointing a parent at a
// dead link. The fix is one line in the edge function that builds the link, not
// a change to 0017 — see odd/tasks/guardian-consent-app-flow.md, "The revoke
// defect".
