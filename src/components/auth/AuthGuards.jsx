// Hito 4 + WU2 + WU4: two server-owned gates in front of every protected route.
//   1. date of birth (scenario 1, D2): an account that has not declared a
//      date of birth is NOT an adult — it is UNKNOWN, and unknown is blocked.
//      This renders DateOfBirthRequired in place of the app routes.
//   2. guardian consent (scenario 2): a KNOWN minor without an ACTIVE consent
//      is locked behind GuardianConsentRequired.
// Everything else reaches <Outlet />.
//
// ⚠ Gate 2 changed meaning in 0031 (WU4) and the difference is the whole work
// unit. Hito 4 let a minor type a guardian's name into their own form and the
// consent RPC returned an 'active' row, so this gate opened on the spot without
// any guardian being involved. Since 0031 a submitted request is 'pending' and
// the ledger stays 'pending' until the guardian follows the emailed link, so the
// `status === 'active'` test below is now a real check rather than a formality.
// Nothing in this component had to change to get that right — which is the point
// of keeping the rule server-side: the client gate was already correct, and
// fixing the defect did not require trusting the client any more than before.
//
// The age facts come from public.my_age_status (0030) — the server is the only
// source that can answer them, because date_of_birth / is_minor have no client
// select grant. user.isMinor is deliberately NOT consulted: it comes from
// GoTrue user_metadata, which the account holder can edit through updateUser(),
// and treating it as authoritative is the bypass this gate exists to close.
