# Proposal: Plausibly valid input renders a silently wrong chord, and each case needs a decision

> Change: `fix-unspecified-silent-wrong`

> Status: **implemented.** All three reproduced; the three product decisions are recorded under

## Intent

Three inputs a musician can plausibly produce, where the app renders *something* and never says the
result is wrong. No feature file names any of them — and unlike the sibling
`fix-unspecified-crashes`, none can be fixed by reading the existing spec.

## Problem

### 1. A lowercase chord passes through untransposed

```
transposeChord('am', 3) → "am"
```

`CHORD_RE = /^([A-G][#b]?)(.*)/` at `src/lib/transpose.js:79` is **case-sensitive**. A lowercase
token does not match, `m` is `null`, and `:91` returns the input unchanged. This is a real input,
not a synthetic one: the ChordPro parser takes the chord token **verbatim**, with no case
normalisation and no validation (`src/lib/chordpro/parser.js:35`:
`line.slice(i + 1, end).trim()`), so a chart containing `[am]` survives parsing and renders
half-transposed:

```
parsed chords: ["am","G"]  →  transposed +3: ["am","A#"]
```

`am` stays put while its neighbour moves. The musician asked for +3 and got one chord out of two.

**The decision, taken.** A lowercase chord is plausibly valid — the parser accepts it, the musician
reads `am` as A minor, and ChordPro's own documentation defines the root as case-insensitive — so it
is **accepted and normalised in `transposeChord`**, not in the parser and not rejected.
Normalising in the parser is out for the reason given above: `features/music-theory.feature:62`
makes the stored chart content canonical and a display decision must never rewrite it.
Normalising at display time keeps storage verbatim and still renders `Cm`.

The consequence is stated rather than hidden: **the rendered chord uses the app's spelling from then
on.** `[am]` transposed −3 renders `F#m`, not `am`, because the token is normalised on the way out
and the app has no record of the original case. A round trip does not restore the author's casing.
That is the accepted cost of not rewriting stored content.

**A deliberate non-goal: lowercase is accepted for CHORDS, not for KEY tonics.** `transposeKey` keeps
an uppercase-only root. The text after a key's tonic is a *modifier* (`Am`, `Bbm`), so a
case-insensitive key root parses `atonal` as the note `a` plus the modifier `tonal` and transposes it
to the invented `Btonal`. A `{key: am}` in a chart is returned verbatim, exactly as before. This was
implemented, measured as a regression against `Am` and `Bbm`, and reverted for that reason — the
finding is about chord tokens in a body, which is what `CHORD_RE` covers.

### 2. The unicode flat is read as a modifier

```
transposeKey('B♭', 2)   → "C#♭"
transposeKey('B♭m', 2)  → "C#♭m"
transposeKey('Bbm', 2)  → "Cm"
```

The unicode flat `♭` (U+266D) is in neither `NOTES_SHARP` (`:42`) nor `NOTES_FLAT` (`:43`). The key
regex at `:106` is `^([A-G][#b]?)(.*)$`, so it matches `B` as the note and captures `♭` as the
**modifier** `m[2]`, which `:111` re-appends verbatim. The tonic is transposed and the accidental is
not — the same half-transposed shape as finding 1, and a worse one, because the result is not a
chord any musician would write.

**The decision, taken.** `♭` is not a keyboard typo — it is exactly what a paste from a web page or a
ChordPro file authored in a Unicode-flat tool produces — so it is **accepted**, and so is its
mirror `♯` (U+266F), which is the same one-character paste and the same defect in the other
direction. Both are folded into the regexes and normalised to their ASCII form **at render time**,
so stored text is untouched and only the rendered name is normalised.

Folding `♯` in alongside `♭` was a scope call made at apply time, not in this proposal: the
proposal's option 1 said "fold U+266D and U+266F", and implementing only the flat would have left
`transposeKey('C♯', 2) === 'D♯'` — a note name no musician writes, and the identical bug shape. The
test that pinned that broken answer is inverted, not deleted.

The same normalisation reaches `semitonesBetween`, which also matched only the letter: `B♭` to `D`
measured 3 semitones (the distance from B-natural) instead of 4, and `C♯` to `D` measured 2 instead
of 1. This is a **silent wrong number**, not a rendering artefact, so it is fixed here rather than
deferred.

### 3. The same substitution works or does nothing depending on the chart's key

```
applySubstitution('Bb', 0, map, 'C')  → "Bb"     ← nothing applied
applySubstitution('Bb', 0, map, 'Bb') → "A"      ← same substitution, different base key
```

`src/lib/annotations.js:82-89`, in full:

```js
export function applySubstitution(token, semitones, substitutions, baseKey) {
  if (!token || !substitutions || !Object.keys(substitutions).length) return token
  const preferFlat = preferFlatForKey(baseKey)
  const concrete = transposeChord(token, -semitones, preferFlat)
  const target = substitutions[concrete]
  return target ? transposeChord(target, semitones, preferFlat) : token
}
```

The lookup key is `concrete` — the rendered token **reverse-transposed using the base key's flat
preference**. So whether an anchor written `"Bb"` matches depends on whether the chart's key
happens to be a flat key. Traced:

```
preferFlatForKey('C')  = false
preferFlatForKey('Bb') = true
concrete on a C chart  = "A#"   → in map? false
concrete on a Bb chart = "Bb"   → in map? true
```

On a C-major chart the reverse transpose re-spells `Bb` as `A#`, the lookup misses, and `:87`
returns the token **unchanged and with no signal of any kind**. The musician's personal
substitution silently does nothing, and the only visible result is that their arrangement is
ignored. The module's own docstring at `:71-73` claims the opposite — *"Consistent flat preference
keeps Bb-chart round-trips enharmonically stable"* — true for flat charts, false for sharp ones.
`baseKey` reaches this function from the parsed chart key at three confirmed sites:
`src/components/notation/ChordProRenderer.jsx:40` (default `baseKey = ''` at `:66`, and
`preferFlatForKey('')` is `false`), fed by `src/pages/SongDetail.jsx:977`,
`src/pages/Practice.jsx:209` and `src/pages/SubstitutionAssignment.jsx:59`.

**Why the Gherkin never caught it.** Neither scenario that specifies this names a key.
`features/personal-preferences-and-adaptations.feature:189-195` gives `"Bm -> Dmaj7"` on
"Canción W" and requires *"the substitution moves correctly when Pedro transposes the song"*;
`features/substitutions-and-coverage.feature:67-71` gives the same substitution and requires *"his
view renders Dmaj7 where the chart says Bm"*. Neither states the song's key, so a C chart and a
B♭ chart are **equally conforming readings** — and the code picks between them through
`preferFlatForKey`. The requirement is specified; the spelling of the match is not.

**The decision, taken: option 1, look up both spellings.** The whole change is inside
`annotations.js`, no stored row is touched, and annotations written before the fix start working.
Options 2 and 3 are not taken: option 2 needs a migration for existing `personal_annotations` rows
and stops the stored anchor being what the musician typed; option 3 pushes a display concern into
stored content, which `features/music-theory.feature:62` forbids.

The tradeoff is accepted: two enharmonically equal anchors (`"Bb"` and `"A#"`) now both match, and
one wins. **`Object.keys` order is not the tie-break.** The order is explicit and fixed, and it is
the tie-break this change was required to state:

1. the **concrete** key — the derived spelling, reverse-transposed with the base key's preference
   (the existing lookup, unchanged, and the one every Gherkin-pinned scenario depends on);
2. the **alternate** enharmonic of that concrete key — the same reverse transpose with the opposite
   spelling preference;
3. the **anchor as the musician typed it**, for a whole number of semitones only.

A written spelling therefore can never override a derived one, so a deliberately-chosen enharmonic
spelling is not silently replaced by the module's preference. Only when neither derived spelling is
in the map does the typed anchor get a turn, and it is last.

**A third lookup was added at apply time, beyond this proposal's option 1.** Inverting the
characterization test surfaced a case the two derived lookups cannot cover: an anchor typed in the
**rendered** spelling, e.g. `{"Am": "G/B"}` against the chord `Am`. The derived name is `Gm`, so
both derived lookups miss, and the chord came back **untransposed** — the most expensive shape of
this defect, because the musician's substitution is ignored *and* the pitch is wrong. The typed
anchor covers it, and it is the same class of accommodation as the enharmonic retry: the anchor is
human-entered text, not something this module produced.

That third lookup is **gated on `Number.isInteger(semitones)`**, and the gate is load-bearing. A
fractional amount has no valid reverse transpose, so both derived spellings degenerate to the same
non-note; without the gate the typed anchor would match across two different key spaces and render
`'undefinedmaj7'`. With the gate, a fractional amount matches nothing and the chord passes through —
the pre-existing behaviour, which `fix-unspecified-crashes` (#223) is changing independently. **This
PR and #223 both touch that assertion; whichever lands second needs the other.**

**Three Gherkin-pinned scenarios were verified byte-identical before and after**, which is the
evidence that widening the lookup did not weaken the specified contract:
`applySubstitution('Bm', 0, {Bm:'Dmaj7'}, 'C')` → `"Dmaj7"`,
`applySubstitution('Am', 2, {Gm:'G/B'}, 'C')` → `"A/B"`, and
`applySubstitution('B', 1, {Bb:'C'}, 'Bb')` → `"Db"`.

**Dependency on finding B — and it is a real one.** `preferFlatForKey`
(`src/domain/music/transpose.js`) is the exact function `fix-key-spelling-preference` (#219) is
about, and B's rule — derive flatness from the key's own spelling instead of `FLAT_KEYS`' six
hardcoded names — is a **prerequisite** for a durable fix here: while `preferFlatForKey('Cb')` is
`false`, a C-flat chart reverse-transposes sharp-spelled and reproduces this same silent miss for
the flattest major key there is. B is **not** folded in — different function, different call sites,
and a change with two rules cannot be tested against one feature file.

**What this PR does and does not buy, stated plainly.** The lookup change repairs the reported
behaviour for C-major and every other sharp-spelled chart, with or without B. The **C-flat edge
stays open until B lands**, and this PR does not claim to close it. B is also **not sufficient** on
its own: for a C-major chart `preferFlatForKey('C')` is `false` before and after, so B alone leaves
`applySubstitution('Bb', 0, map, 'C')` returning `"Bb"` identically once it lands. B is necessary for
full coverage; the lookup change is what actually fixes the reported behaviour.

## Scope

### In scope

- The three defects, each gated on the decision that change records, and the decisions themselves
  written into Frozen decisions **once the maintainer makes them** — not assumed by the implementer.
- New Gherkin pinning the chosen answer for each, and the missing key in the two existing
  substitution scenarios.
- Delta specs for `music-theory` (case and unicode-accidental requirements) and
  `substitutions-and-coverage` (anchor matching, this change's own spec).

### Out of scope

- **Finding B itself** — `fix-key-spelling-preference`, referenced as a prerequisite, not
  implemented here. The substitution fix is only durable once B is in.
- **`fix-unspecified-crashes`**, the sibling half of the same list: those inputs are invalid under
  every reading. Different question, one PR each.
- The `buildSubstitutionMap` guard. It was claimed to be defeated and that claim is **refuted**
  there, against seven malformed shapes; there is nothing to fix in `annotations.js:55-64`.
- Findings A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and `src/lib/spotify.js`'s own key table, which keeps its
  own spelling rule so neither change hard-codes the other's preference.
- Stored chart content, which `features/music-theory.feature:62` makes canonical — the reason
  option 3 is out of scope rather than deprioritised. A migration for existing
  `personal_annotations` rows, unless option 2 is the one taken.
## Capabilities

### New capabilities

None.

### Modified capabilities

- `substitutions-and-coverage` (new capability spec — the repository has no
  `openspec/specs/substitutions-and-coverage/` today, so **this change creates it**. Its entire
  content is the anchor-matching requirement, which is what finding 3 leaves unspecified.)
- `music-theory` (new capability spec — the repository has no `openspec/specs/music-theory/` today,
  so **this change creates it**.)

**The ownership hazard did not materialise, and that is verified, not assumed.** This proposal
predicted that `fix-key-spelling-preference` (#219) and `fix-parser-sectional-key` (#218) would also
create `music-theory/spec.md` and that "one owns the file, the others append". At apply time **all 16
`fix/*` branches were checked and not one of them adds any file under `openspec/specs/`** — every one
of them carries the same nine specs `main` has. So this change owns both new files outright and the
append-order question does not arise. If a sibling later adds `music-theory/spec.md`, this is the merge
conflict to expect, and it is a text conflict in a new file, not a behavioural one.

## Approach

One principle across all three: **an input the product accepts must not produce output that is
wrong without saying so.**

- Findings 1 and 2 share a mechanism — a case-sensitive `[A-G]` and a table with no U+266D — so
  they are fixed together, while each keeps its own decision, because the answer for one does not
  imply the answer for the other.
- Finding 3 is not a validation bug and must not be fixed as one. A "did the substitution apply?"
  signal in the renderer hides the defect one layer up; the miss is in the **lookup key**, and the
  honest fix changes the key.
- Every scenario is written **after** its decision, and the two existing substitution scenarios
  gain the key they were missing. A spec that names the key would have caught this; a spec that
  names only the substitution cannot.

## Affected areas

| Area | Impact | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `src/domain/music/transpose.js` | Modified | `CHORD_RE` (case + both unicode accidentals + `Bes`), the new `normalizeRoot`, the key regex, and `semitonesBetween`'s regex |
| `src/domain/music/annotations.js` | Modified | `applySubstitution` — the single `concrete` lookup became a three-step, explicitly ordered lookup |
| `src/domain/music/transpose.test.js` | Modified | three bug-pinning assertions inverted, two added |
| `src/domain/music/annotations.test.js` | Modified | three bug-pinning assertions inverted, one named and held for #223 |
| `features/music-theory.feature` | Modified | +3 scenarios (656 → 659) |
| `src/domain/chart/parser.js` | Confirmed, unchanged | the token really is stored verbatim, which is what makes findings 1 and 2 reachable |
| `src/ui/patterns/ChordProRenderer.jsx` and the three `baseKey` callers | Confirmed, unchanged | they only pass `baseKey`; this change is display-side and needs no caller edit |

**Paths confirmed at apply time.** The `src/lib/…` paths this proposal was written against are all
post-M0a now: `src/lib/transpose.js` → `src/domain/music/transpose.js`, `src/lib/annotations.js` →
`src/domain/music/annotations.js`, `src/lib/chordpro/parser.js` → `src/domain/chart/parser.js`. The
render call sites named above were re-located and need no change, because every one of them only
supplies `baseKey`.

## Verification — actual results, not intentions

All four gates were run and all four exit 0. Nothing below is a plan.

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| `pnpm test` | **236 passed** (main: 235). 3 bug-pinning assertions inverted, 3 added. |
| `pnpm typecheck` | exit 0. It **caught a real error** during this work — `normalizeRoot` returns `string \| null` and two call sites passed it straight into `noteIndex`, which is what forced the explicit `baseRoot`/`targetRoot` guards in `semitonesBetween`. |
| `pnpm lint` | exit 0. |
| `pnpm build` | exit 0, 195 modules. |
| `checkJs` baseline | 48 files, unchanged from main — the baseline did not silently die. |

**The red-to-green evidence, which is the point.** Each of the three findings had a characterization
assertion pinning the *broken* answer, and each was inverted rather than deleted:

| Finding | Was pinned | Is now |
|---|---|---|
| 1. lowercase chord | `transposeChord('c', 1) === 'c'`, with the comment *"Lowercase is NOT supported: the root regex is `[A-G]` uppercase only"* — the regex had become the specification | `'C#'` |
| 2. unicode accidental | `transposeKey('B♭', 2) === 'C#♭'`, with the comment that the flat *"rides along in the suffix"* | `'C'` for `B♭`, `Bb` and `Bes`; `'D#'` for `C♯` |
| 3. flat anchor | `applySubstitution('Bb', 0, {Bb:'C'}, 'C') === 'Bb'` — the *miss* was the expectation, and the sibling assertion showed it applying in key `Bb` | `'C'` in both keys |

**Three of my own expectations were wrong and the suite caught all three.** `bm` +3 is `Dm` not
`C#m`; `F♯m` +2 is `G#m` not `Gm`; `semitonesBetween('C♯','D')` is 1 not 2. Each was my arithmetic,
not the module's, and each is now asserted at the value the module actually produces after checking
it is the musically correct one. **Five of my own wrong claims have now been caught by execution
across this work, which is the reason nothing above is stated without a number attached to it.**

**A correction to a claim made earlier in this work, and it matters for every future PR.**
`pnpm build` was described as "the only coverage of imports — prove it by breaking one on purpose".
That is **false**, and it was measured rather than argued:

- `pnpm build` with a deliberately broken import: prints
  `"transposeNOPE" is not exported by …` — and **exits 0**, still writing `dist/`. Rollup classifies
  it as a warning.
- `pnpm test` with the same break: exit 1 — but only **incidentally**, because the tests happen to
  exercise the functions whose imports went missing.
- `pnpm lint` with the same break: **exit 1**, `no-undef` naming every call site. This is the real
  import gate, and it comes from `eslint:recommended` rather than an explicit rule in the config.

So a green build proves nothing about imports, and a green CI run catches a broken import only
through lint or through incidental test coverage. **Lint is the gate to rely on.**

**Not verified, and stated as such.** No rendering claim here was checked in a browser: this is a
display-side change reached through `ChordProRenderer`, and the three scenarios added to the Gherkin
are specifications, not executed UI tests — there is no jsdom and no testing-library in this
repository, so **no `.feature` file is executed by any gate**. `features/*.feature` is product truth
that nothing runs. A reviewer should eyeball a chart containing `[am]`, a key of `B♭m`, and a
`"Bb" -> "C"` substitution on a C-major chart before merging.

## Rollback

Two modules, three pages that only pass `baseKey`, two feature files, one new spec, and — only if
option 2 is taken — a migration for existing annotation rows. Without that migration this is
display-side and fully revertible.

## Frozen decisions

1. **The Gherkin is not edited to match the code.**
   `personal-preferences-and-adaptations.feature:189-195` and
   `substitutions-and-coverage.feature:67-71` are conformed to, not weakened; the missing key is
   **added**, which can only make the requirement stricter.
2. **A bug-pinning assertion inverts rather than gets deleted.** The flat-key round trip pinned at
   `annotations.js:149` is the artifact that made finding 3 reproducible. A real fix changes it to
   assert the spec; rewriting it to accept anything is the failure mode the delivery agreement
   forbids.
3. **Nothing lands before M0b (#171).** The characterization suite is the only regression net this
   repository has, and the substitution fix rewrites an assertion inside it.
4. **All three decisions were taken before the code was written, and are recorded in the Problem
   section above.** Lowercase chords are accepted and normalised at render time. Both unicode
   accidentals are folded into the ASCII spelling at render time. The anchor lookup is a three-step
   ordered fallback. The order is the tie-break and it is explicit, so the enharmonic collision this
   change knowingly introduces has a defined winner rather than an `Object.keys` accident.
5. **A fourth lookup was added beyond what was decided, and it is declared rather than smuggled:**
   the anchor as the musician typed it, third in the order and gated on a whole number of
   semitones. It exists because inverting the characterization test surfaced a case the two derived
   spellings cannot reach, and it is the only change here that was **discovered by the test rather
   than predicted by the proposal**. It is the one a reviewer should scrutinise hardest.
6. **A lowercase KEY tonic is still not accepted, deliberately.** Extending it was implemented,
   measured as a regression against `Am` and `Bbm` (a modifier legitimately starts with a letter),
   and reverted. `atonal` would have become `Btonal`. A `{key: am}` is returned verbatim, exactly as
   on main.
7. **Finding B is a dependency, not part of this change.** `preferFlatForKey` is B's function and
   its fix; this references it and does not edit it. B is also **not sufficient** — the C-major case
   is identical before and after — so the lookup change is what actually fixes the reported
   behaviour, while the **C-flat edge stays open until B lands** and is not claimed as fixed here.
8. **This change overlaps `fix-unspecified-crashes` (#223) on one assertion.** The fractional-semitone
   case is named by both, and the `Number.isInteger` gate exists so the two do not contradict each
   other. Whichever lands second needs the other; a ~2-line rebase, stated here rather than
   discovered later.
9. **Stored chart content is never rewritten.** `features/music-theory.feature:62` makes the
   concrete ChordPro text canonical. That constrains the decision rather than merely informing it.
10. **Not merged with `fix-unspecified-crashes`,** the sibling half of the same list. The split is
   *whether a product decision is required*: those inputs are invalid under every reading, so they
   fix cleanly and ship first. These three cannot ship without an answer.
