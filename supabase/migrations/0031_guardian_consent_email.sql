-- CEMURM 0031 — Guardian consent by email: the 'pending' state, the two
-- token-based RPCs, and the Vault-backed Resend key
--
-- Slice: feat/auth-fail-closed-social — work unit 4 of the change
-- "Auth — fail-closed minors + social signup + guardian email"
-- (odd/tasks/auth-fail-closed-social.md, tasks T4.1–T4.2).
-- Business contract (features/minors-and-guardian-consent.feature):
--  · signup age gate (scenario 1): UNCHANGED. A declared minor date still
--    routes the account into the consent flow (0030), and an adult is still
--    released by the same step. Nothing here reads or writes the age fact.
--  · account activation (scenario 2) — THE DEFECT THIS MIGRATION CLOSES.
--    0017 line 88 shipped `status text not null default 'active'` and the
--    consent RPC inserted without a status, so consent was SELF-ASSERTED: the
--    account holder typed a guardian's name into their own form and the row
--    came out 'active', which unlocked the account on the spot. Nothing ever
--    asked a guardian. D4 replaces that default with 'pending', so a request
--    opens a locked account and only the guardian can close it (scenario 5).
--  · consent record (scenario 3): the ledger keeps the guardian's identity and
--    the exact consent text they saw. `consented_at` becomes NULLABLE and is
--    written only by the confirm path — a pending row that already carried a
--    consent date would be a record of something that never happened, and this
--    table is supervision evidence.
--  · lifecycle (scenarios 5/7/8/9): confirm is the login-less sibling of the
--    revoke capability 0017 lines 361-417 already shipped; revocation is NOT
--    reimplemented here, it is reused. Revoking still never deletes (scenario 9)
--    and the minor→adult archive (0017 lines 53-57) is untouched, so turning 18
--    still ends the archive (scenario 8).
--  · public-sharing gate (scenario 4) and public-surface exclusion
--    (scenario 6): NOT recreated. 0029 owns them and this migration changes
--    nothing about what they do — a 'pending' row simply does not satisfy the
--    `status = 'active'` test they already read, which is the point.
--
-- ⚠ THE NEW PUBLIC SURFACE. `public.confirm_guardian_consent_by_token` is
-- granted to `anon` on purpose: a guardian must be able to act from an email
-- link with no account. That makes it the app's first unauthenticated,
-- state-mutating endpoint reachable by anyone on the internet, and every rule
-- below exists to keep it inert without the token:
--   · the 128-bit `revocation_token` IS the capability; there is no other input;
--   · EVERY failure raises the same message, so a wrong token, an unknown user,
--     an already-confirmed consent and a no-longer-minor account are
--     indistinguishable to the caller. No user id, email or status ever leaves
--     the function — not in the message, not in the return value;
--   · the whole effect is one UPDATE of one row's status, and only
--     'pending' → 'active'.
--
-- Conventions (0002/0012/0017/0029/0030 style): comment headers with a scenario
-- map; SECURITY DEFINER cores in `private` with `set search_path = ''` +
-- fully-qualified refs; thin public wrappers (0017 lines 304-313); REVOKE from
-- public/anon THEN GRANT per role; grants AFTER policies (D6 order).
-- MIGRATIONS ARE IMMUTABLE: 0017, 0029 and 0030 are left exactly as shipped.
-- The 'active' default and the one-active index are REMOVED here by altering
-- the table, never by editing the historical migration.


-- ══════════════════════ 1. THE 'pending' STATE ══════════════════════
-- Status is now a four-value state machine with an explicit vocabulary. The
-- check constraint is what stops a future typo from minting a row that is
-- neither pending, active, revoked nor archived — an orphan status would be
-- invisible to every gate and would read as "not consented" forever, which is
-- at least fail-closed, but it would also be invisible in the ledger.
alter table public.guardian_consents
  add constraint guardian_consents_status_known
  check (status in ('pending', 'active', 'revoked', 'archived'));

-- The D4 default. Fail-closed at the schema level: an insert that forgets to
-- state a status can no longer produce an unlocked account.
alter table public.guardian_consents alter column status set default 'pending';

-- scenario 3's "the date" is the date the consent was GIVEN. There is no such
-- date before the guardian clicks, so the column becomes nullable AND loses its
-- default: `not null default now()` would keep stamping a request with a
-- consent date, which is the same false record in a different place. The confirm
-- path (section 3) is the only writer from here on.

alter table public.guardian_consents alter column consented_at drop default;

-- The partial unique index, revisited. 0017 line 100 admitted one 'active' row
-- per user, which left the new state unguarded: two 'pending' rows would put two
-- approval emails in one guardian's inbox for the same decision, and a 'pending'
-- row sitting next to an 'active' one would make "is this account supervised?"
-- answerable two ways. The index now covers every OPEN row, so at most one
-- request-or-approval exists at a time; finalized rows (revoked/archived) stay
-- unconstrained so the ledger keeps growing.

-- ── 4.1 public wrapper — service_role ONLY (0012/0017 pattern, NOT an oversight)
-- The Edge Function is a PostgREST client like any other, and PostgREST only
-- serves the `public` schema here (verified: PGRST202 for every `private.*`
-- function). The alternatives were both worse:
--   · exposing the `private` schema — 48 of its 54 functions are already
--     EXECUTE-granted to `authenticated` (0012/0017/0030 all grant their cores
--     to the client), so that one config line would publish 48 new endpoints
--     instead of one;
--   · no wrapper at all — impossible: the function could not be called.
-- So the key reader gets the same core + thin wrapper shape as every other
-- entry point in this schema, and the PROTECTION is the grant below, not the
-- wrapper's absence. `anon` and `authenticated` hold no key and get
-- `permission denied for function read_resend_api_key`; 0031's smoke asserts
-- that on all three of PUBLIC, anon and authenticated. The key is one
-- PostgREST call away from `anon` in exactly the same way every other
